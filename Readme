Mysql support needs: libmysqlclient16

Compiling (With mysql support): 
g++ main.cpp irc.cpp game.cpp -o GameServ -lmysqlclient

Compiling (Without mysql support): 
Same as above only without "-lmysqlclient" be sure to comment out the line "#define USE_MYSQL" in defines.h as well.

For Windows support: (Experimental)
Comment out "#define LINUX" and uncomment "#define WINDOWS" in defines.h
